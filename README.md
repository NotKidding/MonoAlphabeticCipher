# Mono-Alphabetic Cipher

A simple Python program for encrypting and decrypting text using a randomized mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. This project demonstrates basic concepts in encryption by substituting each character in a text with a unique, shuffled character from a predefined set of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.

## Features

- **Encrypt**: Encrypts plaintext by substituting each character with a mapped character from a randomly shuffled set.
- **Decrypt**: Reverses the encryption process to recover the original plaintext from the ciphertext.
- **Randomized Mapping**: The character mappings are shuffled at each program run, creating unique encryption per session.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: A simple text-based menu that allows users to select encryption, decryption, or exit options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the `MonoAlphaCipher.py` file.
2. Run the script with Python:
   ```bash
   python MonoAlphaCipher.py
